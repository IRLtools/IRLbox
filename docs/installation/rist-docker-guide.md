# RIST Relay – Docker Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the **RIST Relay** using Docker containers for easy setup and management.

---

## 1. Overview

The **RIST Relay** lets you relay RIST streams through your own server using Docker containers.

This containerized approach simplifies deployment and management.
