# RIST Relay – Standalone Guide

This guide explains how to install and run the **RIST Relay** as a standalone application on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

## 1. Overview

The **RIST Relay** lets you relay RIST streams through your own server using native binaries.  
Instead of sending a stream *directly* to OBS, OBS can "pull" the stream from the relay.  
This standalone approach gives you direct control over the relay process.
